# Solving The Travel Salesman Problem With Genetic Algorithms

This was developed during a study project conducted in 2018.
For that reason commetary is quite(almost excessively) verbose.
The project primarily involved constructing a heuristic using genetic algorithms from scratch in SciLab, to approximate an optimal solution for the well-known Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). 
Final solution was compared post hoc with other commonly employed algorithmic approaches, like 2-Opt, simulated anealing and prim.
